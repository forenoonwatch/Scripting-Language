TODO:

SHORTER TERM:
- Make errors more logically correct
- Add line number to Token class
- Include line number in error
- Write interpreter
- Add custom memory allocation in pre-allocated block for variables
- Add statement evaluator
- Add ability to keep functions in a [string, function info] map for lookup by the interpreter
- Add similar recursive descent interpreting to recursive descent parsing
- Possibly interpret certain things while parsing
+ Possibly store variables in a [string, variable allocated data] map
+ Create variable class
- Redo expression parsing to not be multi-level, to suit expression evaluator

LONG TERM:
- Possibly create a separate namespace for the scripting language classes
- Name scripting language
- Write scripting language in such a way that statements can be interpreted while also in a
  loop of other things going on (possible with the whole if can interpret then interpret one block logic)
